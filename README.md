---

## Customize Your Agent

### 1. Define your agent's character

Edit `characters/agent.character.json` to define your agent's personality, knowledge, and behavior:

```json
{
  "name": "MyAgent",
  "bio": ["Your agent's backstory and capabilities"],
  "system": "Your agent's core instructions and behavior",
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap", "@elizaos/plugin-openai"],
  "clients": ["direct"]
}
```

### 2. Add plugins

Extend your agent by adding plugins to `package.json` and your character file:

| Plugin | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` | Required base plugin |
| `@elizaos/plugin-openai` | OpenAI-compatible LLM (required for Nosana endpoint) |
| `@elizaos/plugin-web-search` | Web search capability |
| `@elizaos/plugin-telegram` | Telegram bot client |
| `@elizaos/plugin-discord` | Discord bot client |
| `@elizaos/plugin-twitter` | Twitter/X integration |
| `@elizaos/plugin-browser` | Browser/web automation |
| `@elizaos/plugin-sql` | Database access |

Install a plugin:
```bash
pnpm add @elizaos/plugin-web-search
```

Add it to your character file:
```json
{
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap", "@elizaos/plugin-openai", "@elizaos/plugin-web-search"]
}
```

### 3. Build custom actions (optional)

Add your own custom logic in `src/index.ts`. See the example plugin already included.

### 4. Persistent storage

SQLite is configured by default — sufficient for development and small-scale agents. For a production-grade personal agent, consider:

- A mounted volume on Nosana
- External database (PostgreSQL, PlanetScale, etc.)
- Decentralized storage (Arweave, IPFS)

---

## Deploy to Nosana

> **Important:** For this challenge, you must deploy your agent to Nosana's decentralized infrastructure. Do **not** use the standard `elizaos deploy` command — that deploys to centralized cloud providers. This challenge is about embracing decentralized compute.

**Why Nosana?**
- **Decentralized** — Your agent runs on a distributed network of GPU providers, not AWS/GCP/Azure
- **Cost-effective** — Use your free builders credits (no credit card required)
- **Permissionless** — No vendor lock-in, full control over your infrastructure
- **Challenge requirement** — All submissions must be deployed on Nosana

### Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running
- A [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account (free)
- Your [Nosana builders credits](https://nosana.com/builders-credits) claimed

### Step 1: Build and Push Your Docker Image

Your agent needs to be containerized and available on a public registry (Docker Hub) so Nosana nodes can pull and run it.

```bash
# Build your Docker image
docker build -t yourusername/nosana-eliza-agent:latest .

# Test it locally first (recommended)
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env yourusername/nosana-eliza-agent:latest

# Visit http://localhost:3000 to verify it works

# Log in to Docker Hub
docker login

# Push to Docker Hub (make it public)
docker push yourusername/nosana-eliza-agent:latest
```

> **Tip:** Replace `yourusername` with your actual Docker Hub username. Make sure your repository is **public** so Nosana nodes can pull it.

### Step 2: Configure Your Job Definition

Edit `nos_job_def/nosana_eliza_job_definition.json` and update the Docker image reference:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1",
  "type": "container",
  "meta": {
    "trigger": "cli"
  },
  "ops": [
    {
      "type": "container/run",
      "id": "eliza-agent",
      "args": {
        "image": "yourusername/nosana-eliza-agent:latest",  // <- Change this
        "ports": ["3000:3000"],
        "env": {
          "OPENAI_API_KEY": "nosana",
          "OPENAI_API_URL": "https://6vq2bcqphcansrs9b88ztxfs88oqy7etah2ugudytv2x.node.k8s.prd.nos.ci/v1",
          "MODEL_NAME": "Qwen3.5-27B-AWQ-4bit"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Security Note:** For production deployments, avoid hardcoding sensitive environment variables. Consider using Nosana secrets management or external secret stores.

### Step 3: Deploy via Nosana Dashboard (Easiest)

This is the recommended method for beginners:

1. Visit the [Nosana Dashboard](https://dashboard.nosana.com/deploy)
2. Connect your Solana wallet (you need this for authentication and using credits)
3. Click **Expand** to open the job definition editor
4. Copy and paste the contents of your `nos_job_def/nosana_eliza_job_definition.json` file
5. Select your preferred compute market:
   - `nvidia-3090` — High performance (recommended for production)
   - `nvidia-rtx-4090` — Premium performance
   - `cpu-only` — Budget option (slower inference)
6. Click **Deploy**
7. Wait for a node to pick up your job (usually 30-60 seconds)
8. Once running, you'll receive a public URL to access your agent

### Step 4: Deploy via Nosana CLI (Advanced)

For developers who prefer the command line or want to automate deployments:

1. First get your API key at [https://deploy.nosana.com/account/](https://deploy.nosana.com/account/)
2. Edit the [Nosana ElizaOS Job Definition File](./nos_job_def/nosana_eliza_job_definition.json)
3. Learn more about [Nosana Job Definition Here](https://learn.nosana.com/deployments/jobs/job-definition/intro.html)

```bash
# Install the Nosana CLI globally
npm install -g @nosana/cli

# Deploy your agent
nosana job post \
  --file ./nos_job_def/nosana_eliza_job_definition.json \
  --market nvidia-4090 \
  --timeout 300 \
  --api <API_KEY>

# Monitor your deployment
nosana job status <job-id>

# View logs
nosana job logs <job-id>
```

**CLI Flags Explained:**
- `--file` — Path to your job definition JSON
- `--market` — Which GPU market to use (nvidia-3090, nvidia-rtx-4090, etc.)
- `--timeout` — Maximum job runtime in minutes

### Step 5: Verify Your Deployment

Once your job is running on Nosana:

1. **Test the endpoint** — Visit the public URL provided by Nosana
2. **Check agent responsiveness** — Send a test message to your agent
3. **Monitor logs** — Use the Nosana Dashboard or CLI to view logs
4. **Verify inference** — Ensure the Qwen3.5-27B model is responding correctly

### Troubleshooting

**Agent not starting?**
- Check that your Docker image is public on Docker Hub
- Verify your job definition JSON is valid
- Ensure environment variables are correctly set
- Check Nosana dashboard logs for error messages

**Slow response times?**
- Consider using a higher-tier GPU market (nvidia-rtx-4090)
- Optimize your ElizaOS configuration
- Check if the Nosana inference endpoint is reachable

**Out of credits?**
- Visit [nosana.com/builders-credits](https://nosana.com/builders-credits) to check your balance
- Credits are airdropped twice daily — be patient if you just signed up

**Need help?**
- Join the [Nosana Discord](https://nosana.com/discord) for support
- Check the [Nosana documentation](https://learn.nosana.io)
- Review the [Nosana CLI docs](https://github.com/nosana-ci/nosana-cli)
